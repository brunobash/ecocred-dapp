# EcoCred DApp

## Overview

**EcoCred** is a decentralized application (DApp) for issuing and querying environmental credits, integrating with the CESS Network blockchain. The project uses Solidity smart contracts deployed on CESS (EVM) and can be easily adapted to store metadata or files using CESS decentralized storage solutions (DeOSS/CDN).

## 1. Problem to Solve

The issuance and tracking of **environmental credits** still face major challenges both in Brazil and globally:

- **Lack of transparency** and risk of fraud in carbon credit and sustainability records.
- **Difficulty in public verification** of sustainable actions by companies and institutions.
- **Low digitization and traceability** of supporting documents.
- **High operational costs** for small and medium-sized organizations to implement environmental certification systems.

**EcoCred** aims to address these issues by offering a **decentralized**, **transparent**, and **auditable** solution for issuing environmental credits using blockchain and decentralized storage.
